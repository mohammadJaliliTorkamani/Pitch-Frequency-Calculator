<br/>

`MATLAB` program to find the pitch frequency of the desired `.wave` file and plot the results.


<br/>

## Requirements
- MATLAB software

<br/>

## Run
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository by clicking on[ this link](https://github.com/mohammadJaliliTorkamani/Pitch-Frequency-Calculator/archive/refs/heads/master.zip " this link") then extract it, or clone it using:
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/mohammadJaliliTorkamani/Pitch-Frequency-Calculator.git
```

2. Copy **Matlab_SP_Project.m**  and **a.wav**  files into your MATLAb project.

3. Run the script
